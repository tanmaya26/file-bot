# Design

## Problem Statement:
In daily life, we come across various ways and processes to store files. It can be maintaining bank account details, salary details, payment details, student information, student reports, books in the library etc. File management and processing is a tedious job which consists of a lot of manual steps which take up a lot of time and introduce human errors. When latency and human error is considered for the file system, they have a tendency to accumulate and become a serious problem.

## Bot Description:
**Tagline** - **FiBot**, one stop bot for File Processing.\
\
We propose a bot which can chat in spoken english with the user and understand the user’s need. The bot can act upon the input and automate the process of handling files and processing them, saving both time and removing human errors. Slack is a fast growing platform for team collaboration leading to sharing of files amongst them. File upload is an important functionality on Slack and it also gives us the functionality to build a bot to search channels, messages and members or talk to a user. We take advantage of these abilities to make the bot understand what the user wants. The Bot responds to user's instructions, maintains a memory and knows the user, it can be categorised under 'Responders'.

### Bot’s Functionality:
- Sharing link generation: Bot can generate temporary or permanent link to share files.
- Compressing/ decompressing file: Bot can take files from the user to zip or unzip files.
- File Versioning: Bot can help keep different versions of the file.
- Watermarking: Bot can help to watermark documents.
- Basic file operations: Bot can perform file operation on file saved on slack like deleting a file from slack when asked.

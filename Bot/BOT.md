## Bot Implementation

## Selenium testing

Currently, we have implemented test cases for three major features of file bot: Watermark, Storage management, Category management. Each 
feature has sub-categories which are also tested and these tests have a happy path and one alternate path. Let's go over the test cases.

1. Watermark
    - Watermark<br>
    USE CASE: Register Watermark<br>
    The happy path for this test case tests for registering a watermark when file format is correct.
    The alternate path tests for registering a watermark when a user uploads an unacceptable format which is jpeg in this case.<br>
    USE CASE: Add Watermark to file
    This test case tests for adding watermark to file.<br>
    USE CASE: Get all watermarks
    This tests for listing all registered watermarks.

    - Storage<br>
